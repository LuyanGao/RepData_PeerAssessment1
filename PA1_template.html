<p>This is an R HTML document. When you click the <b>Knit HTML</b> button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>


```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
if (! file.exists("./project")) {dir.create("./project")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "./project/activity.zip")
unzip("./project/activity.zip", exdir = "./project")
activity <- read.csv("./project/activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
str(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
dayStep <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)
hist(dayStep, main = "Histogram of Steps Taken Each Day", xlab = "Number of Steps")
```

```{r}
meanStep <- mean(tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum), na.rm = TRUE)
meanStep
```

```{r}
medianStep <- median(tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum), na.rm = TRUE)
medianStep
```

The mean of the total number of steps taken per day is r meanStep, the median of the total number of steps taken per day is r medianStep.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
pattern <- activity %>%
        group_by(interval) %>%
        summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
g1 <- ggplot(pattern, aes(interval, avg_steps))
g1 + geom_line() + labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern") + labs(x = "Interval", y = "Number of Steps")
```

```{r}
maxStep <- max(pattern$avg_steps)
maxStep
maxInterval <- pattern$interval[match(maxStep, pattern$avg_steps)]
maxInterval
```
The maximum number of steps is r maxStep steps.

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
NAcount <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
NAcount
```

```{r}
activity_new <- mutate(activity, int_avg = factor(interval, pattern$interval, labels = pattern$avg_steps))
for (i in 1:nrow(activity_new)) {
        if (is.na(activity_new$steps[i])) {
                activity_new$steps[i] <- as.numeric(as.character(activity_new$int_avg[i]))
        }
}
```

In the dataset, there are r NAcount missing valuesin total. By using the mean for each 5-minute interval to replace the NAs, we can thus create a new dataset called activity_new.

```{r}
dayStep_new <- tapply(activity_new$steps, activity_new$date, sum)
hist(dayStep_new, main = "Histogram of Steps Taken Each Day (Missing Data Filled In)", xlab = "Steps")
```

```{r}
meanStep_new <- mean(tapply(activity_new$steps, activity_new$date, sum), na.rm = TRUE)
meanStep_new
```

The mean total number of steps taken per day is not affected by imputing missing data.

```{r}
medianStep_new <- median(tapply(activity_new$steps, activity_new$date, sum), na.rm = TRUE)
medianStep_new
```

The median total number of steps taken per day is infuenced, now it equals to the mean value. 


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
library(lubridate)
activity_new$wday <- wday(activity_new$date)
activity_new$group[activity_new$wday[] == 1 | activity_new$wday[] == 7] <- "weekend"
activity_new$group[activity_new$wday[] >= 2 & activity_new$wday[] <= 6] <- "weekday"
activity_new$group <- as.factor(activity_new$group)
str(activity_new)
```

We create a new factor variable, group to indicate whether the given date is a weekday or on weekend.

```{r}
        group_by(group, interval) %>%
        summarise(group_avg = mean(steps))
g2 <- ggplot(groupData, aes(interval, group_avg))
g2 + geom_line() + facet_grid(group~.) + labs(x = "Interval", y = "Number of Steps")
```

From the panel plot, the number of steps on weekday has a peak in the morning; While on weekends, there is no obvious peak.
